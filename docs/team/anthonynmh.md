### Project: EZ-Schedule

EZ-Schedule is an application that allows for a high-level overview of all events for a particular administrator.

Examples: 
- company manager - employee schedules 
- badminton court manager - badminton court bookings

<br>

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

It is written in Java.
