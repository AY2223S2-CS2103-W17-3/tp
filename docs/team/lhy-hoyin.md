### Project: EZ-Schedule
_EZ-Schedule_ is a desktop application for managing and scheduling of events,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still providing an easy way to visualize all events through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

_EZ-Schedule_ has about 13kLoC and 2.5k lines of documentation.
It is developed in Java, and uses JavaFX to create the GUI.
