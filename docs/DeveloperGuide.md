## **Introduction**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Ez-Schedule_ is a **desktop application for managing and scheduling of events, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still providing an easy way to visualize all events through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

_Ez-Schedule_ will benefit a fast typist who needs to plan and track upcoming events.

### **Architecture**

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`][MainClass] and [`MainApp`][MainAppClass].
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[MainClass]: https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ezschedule/Main.java
[MainAppClass]: https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ezschedule/MainApp.java

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

### **How the Architecture Components Interact With Each**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding 
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using 
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component 
through its interface rather than the concrete class(reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the 
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

### **UI Component**

The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ezschedule/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1000"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. 
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ezschedule/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### **Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ezschedule/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SchedulerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600" />

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SchedulerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### **Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the scheduler data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `uniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list 
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be 
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. 
  This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, 
  they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### **Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both scheduler data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SchedulerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the 
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### **Common Classes**

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ezschedule.commons` package.
