## **Introduction**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Ez-Schedule_ is a **desktop application for managing and scheduling of events, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still providing an easy way to visualize all events through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

_Ez-Schedule_ will benefit a fast typist who needs to plan and track upcoming events.

### **Architecture**

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`][MainClass] and [`MainApp`][MainAppClass].
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

### **How the Architecture Components Interact With Each**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding 
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using 
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component 
through its interface rather than the concrete class(reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the 
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

### **UI Component**

**API** : [`Ui.java`][UiClass]

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1000"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. 
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`][MainWindowClass] is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`][MainWindowView].

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### **Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`][LogicClass]

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SchedulerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600" />

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SchedulerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### **Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`][ModelClass]

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the scheduler data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `uniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list 
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be 
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. 
  This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, 
  they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### **Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`][StorageClass]

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both scheduler data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SchedulerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the 
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### **Common Classes**

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ezschedule.commons` package.

### **Appendix B: Planned Enhancements**

To resolve certain known feature flaws, we have planned to add some enhancements in the near future:

**Data Verification when loading save files**

Currently, the program reads and loads the data from the save files directly.
As long as the data is in the correct format, the data can be loaded successfully.
We plan to enhance this by verifying the validity of the data, 
that is making sure the saved events does not violate constraints such as overlapping time.

This will help to prevent errors made by advanced user who decided to modify the save files directly.
While the advanced user may be aware of the structure of the file,
knowing if the event added has conflict with any existing events can be hard,
especially if there are many existing events.


### **Appendix C: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Presented below are a series of instructions, organized in **Context, Action, Result (CAR)** format, 
that can be followed to perform manual testing of the application.

### **Appendix D: Effort**

**Difficulty Level:** 

**Challenges Faced:**
* During the first milestone, we decided to "morph" by creating a parallel package and using AB3 as code reference.
  We would copy over whichever code we deem relevant. Halfway through the milestone, one of us realised that doing this
  possibly violated [`Constraint-Brownfield`][tp constraints brownfield]. After checking with our tutor/prof, we had to
  restart again, effectively wasting our effort and restricting our duration for `milestone 1` by half.
* During morphing, the refactor of `Person` to `Event`, as well as `AddressBook` to `Scheduler` was tedious and
  required a lot of careful checking. Despite using IDE features like refactor and find-and-replace, there were
  still variable name and comments which we had to change, and we had to painstakingly double-check everything.
* Furthermore, the morphing process also invalidated many of the existing test cases (from AB3) resulting in the 
  Java CI failing for a prolonged period. We spend a lot of time in `milestone 2` changing/fixing the broken test 
  cases, which left us with not a lot of time to implement new features in `milestone 2` and `milestone 3`.

**Effort Required:** High effort for the morphing process.
